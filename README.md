# bioia
henlo this is my really sloppily made bio ia on diabetes & obesity rates. R is such a joy to use. 

I do not remember what to put here. 

**data** folder is obviously all the data, pulled from the International Diabetes Foundation for 2024, and obesity data pulled from WHO

**setup** opens packages and imports the R objects (model & dataframe)

**data_setup** imports the data into dataframes

**data_processing** condenses it into type 2 diabetes (an estimate) & obesity data

The above 2 are not needed, as the dataframe is in the R object **df**. 

**brm** makes the model, not really refined or anything just to look at. Not needed, as there is already an R object (fit_brm)

**plot** is a throwaway terrible plot, with plot-fr.png the image. 

**ppcheck** is just a check on the model. I think it works pretty ok!

This is an absolute miserable readme and project. Comments are...not really helpful likely as I am not using R for much longer. But if you want to flame me, go ahead. I appreciate the help.
